    "# Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating unknown parameters of a population based on sample data. The two main types of estimates used in estimation statistics are point estimates and interval estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the unknown population parameter. A point estimate is calculated using a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, that is assumed to be representative of the population parameter. Point estimates provide a simple and easy-to-understand estimate of the population parameter but do not provide any information about the accuracy or precision of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interval estimate, also known as confidence interval, is a range of values that is used to estimate the unknown population parameter with a specified degree of confidence. An interval estimate is calculated using a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, and a margin of error based on the sample size and the level of confidence desired. Interval estimates provide a more informative estimate of the population parameter than point estimates, as they give an indication of the range of plausible values for the parameter and the level of uncertainty associated with the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In general, point estimates are useful when we want a quick and easy estimate of the population parameter, while interval estimates are more informative and provide a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. However, it is important to note that both point estimates and interval estimates are subject to sampling error and should be interpreted with caution.\n"
